# Ninite Control Script
Simple script that launches ninite and updates applications across your domain silently. 
This tool for the most part is no longer needed with the introduction of the [pro-interface](https://ninite.com/pro-interface)

This is a powershell script that pulls its settings from the NiniteUpdate.ini file, so that is the only file you need to change anything in.
It is desinged to be saved in C:\Ninite\ (as that is where it looks for the ini file. 

Once you have it all setup properly you will want to set a scheduled task on a local admin account to ensure it can run properly.

I will try and support any bugs you might find, but this is a retired project as for the most part it is not needed.
